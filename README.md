# Suppart

# Project intention:

To create a platform that allows for artists to have control of their projects and careers.

This is achieved through a crowdfunding model; artists can post projects of theirs which they want to get funded and ask for donations from their fans/followers.

Similar to other crowdfunding platforms, the project owner will set a funding goal for the project and in turn offer incentives for different donation tiers.

# Example:

Artist-A wants to record a new music video for a song he recorded and has gained some traction on streaming services.

In order to film this video properly he will have several expenses.

Videographer, equipment, props, editing, the list goes on.

So he posts his project and intentions on Suppart, listing a $10,000 goal to get the video done.

He lists 5 donation tiers:

Tier 1 - $20 - donor will receive a signed t-shirt from the artist specific to the music video.

Tier 2 - $50 - donor will receive a unique "thank you video" from the artist and a signed t-shirt.

Tier 3 - $100 - donor will receive an Instagram shoutout from the artist.

Tier 4 - $500 - donor will receive an exlusive 1 of 10 NFT of a clip from the music video and have their name in the video credits.

Tier 5 - $1000 - donor will receive an exclusive 1 of 1 NFT of the full music video, get flown out to be in the video with the artist, and have their name in the credits.

All transactions on the platform will take place on a blockchain network, The Suppart Network.

The Suppart network is an open ledger system that allows users to see how donor funds are utilized.

To transact on the network, donors must convert their currency to Suppart tokens.

Users can purchase their Suppart tokens with BTC, ETH, SOL, LTC, ADA, XRP, or XLM.

Users can also purchase Suppart tokens with USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, or AUD.

When donors purchase their Suppart tokens to make their donation, the tokens are held in escrow until the conclusion of the donation period.

Once the donation period closes, the network will determine what to do with the funds.

If Artist-A reaches his funding goal, the network will release the funds and he will then proceed with the filming of his video and subsequent distribution of the rewards to his donors as promised.

If he does not reach his funding goal, the network will automatically refund all donors their Suppart tokens.

How the artist spends his Suppart tokens will be recorded by the network and be viewable to all donors.

To ensure trust in the network, the artist must document what the funds are being allocated to.

The artist will document and prove that the funds were allocated correctly.

The goal of this platform is to empower artists while allowing for them to have a greater sense of connectivity with their fans.

Artists benefit from having an additional means to fund their projects besides funding it themselves or traditional funding methods with traditional strings attached.

Fans benefit from having a direct connection with the artists that they follow and for the first time in history being able to contribute to their favorite artists' work.
